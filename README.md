# Neuromorphic Vision Workshop: Day 2
In today's coding session you will explore new libraries, build denoising models, and get a hint of optical flow estimation using event cameras.

## Tonic, the closest thing we have to OpenCV for event cameras.

Tonic implements a lot of the basic fundamental routines typically done in an event camera workflow. Tonic has 
- A plethora of event datasets
- The basic frame representations
- Slicing of event streams

You will use tonic today to quickly visualize the results of your denoising algorithms and optical flow estimates.
